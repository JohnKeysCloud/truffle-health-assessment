# Truffle Health UX/UI Assessment 

Truffle Health is a company that helps simplify medical bills, making them easier to understand for patients. They also aid in finding price reductions for the bills as well as a way to pay them.

The goal here was to design a user-friendly UX/UI that organizes a patients bills, lists all relavant information pertaining to their bills (i.e., reasons for specific charges, what insurance is covering, final calculations of the total amounts due).
